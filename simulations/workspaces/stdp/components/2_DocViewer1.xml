<h1>STDP (Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity)</h1>
<br>
<a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Spike-timing_dependent_plasticity"> 
STDP</a> is a form of synaptic plasticity whereby when one neuron ("pre") fires before another to which its
connected ("post") synapse is strengthened, whereas when post fires before pre, the synapse is weakened. 
Intutively causal stimulation strengthens the connection, while intuitively anti-causal stimulation weakens the
connection.
<br><br>
In this simulation the pre and post neurons are coupled to the first and second columns of the table.
Things are currently set up so that the connection will strengthen, since a 1 occurs in the pre column
(column 1) before the 1 in the post column (column 2). To set it up for anti-causal weakening, adjust
the table so that a 1 occurs in column 2 first.   You can also adjust the time-lag between the signals
and observe its effect on rate of learning. To edit the synapse and its stdp rule double click on it.

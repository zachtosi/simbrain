Attempts to find the sub-graph of CIJ with the highest value for knotty-centrality. Carries out a series of exhaustive searches on subsets of the nodes ranked by "indirect" betweenness centrality, then carries out a phase of hill-climbing to see whether the sub-graph can be improved by adding further nodes.|nodes = the sub-graph found|kc = its knotty-centredness|compact = 1 if compact knotty-centrality to be used, 0 otherwise||Written by Murray Shanahan, October 2011|REF: Shanahan M, Wildie M.

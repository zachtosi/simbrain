Draw and Edit Graphs of Vertices and Edges<br>
<br>
 
<font size=+1 color="#990000"><b>Description</b></font>
<code><pre>
<b>graph_gui</b>(A,XY) Loads a graph into the GUI for editing 
 
  Controls: 
    Use the radio buttons to select an action 
      1. To DRAW a new VERTEX, select 'Draw' and 'Vertex'. Then click 
        inside the axes in the desired location. 
      2. To DELETE a VERTEX, select 'Delete' and 'Vertex'. Then click 
        inside the axis near the desired vertex. 
      3. To DRAW an EDGE, select 'Draw' and 'Edge'. Then click and hold 
        the mouse button down on the starting vertex and drag the mouse 
        to the vertex of the desired connection. 
          a. If 'Directed' is selected, a 1-way edge will be created from 
            the first vertex to the second. 
          b. If 'Undirected' is selected, a 2-way edge between the first vertex 
            and the second vertex will be created. 
        Note: 
          If no vertices exist, no edges will be created. 
      4. To DELETE an EDGE, select 'Delete' and 'Edge'. Then click and 
        hold the mouse button down on the starting vertex and drag the mouse 
        to the vertex of the desired connection to delete. 
          a. If 'Directed' is selected, only the 1-way edge between the 
            first vertex and the second will be deleted. 
          b. If 'Undirected' is selected, the entire 2-way edge between the 
            first vertex and the second vertex will be deleted. 
      5. Click the 'Latch Points' checkbox to toggle between rounded and 
        unrounded (x,y) points. 
      6. The number in the edit box specifies a rounding value. For example, 
        a value of 0.5 rounds each (x,y) point to the nearest 0.5 
      7. Click the 'Save Graph' button to save the adjacency matrix (A) and the 
        coordinates (xy) of the graph to a MAT file. 
 
      Note: The display at the bottom of the figure window shows either the (x,y) 
        coordinate of the mouse location or the ID of the closest vertex. 
 
      Note: The following line styles are used to display the graph 
          1. Undirected (2-way) edges are plotted in solid black lines 
          2. Directed (1-way) edges are plotted in two styles 
              a. If the edge connects a larger vertex ID with a smaller ID, 
                 the edge is plotted as a blue dashed line 
              b. If the edge connects a smaller vertex ID with a larger ID, 
                 the edge is plotted as a red dotted line 
          3. Any vertex that is connected to itself is plotted with a 
             black circle around it 
 
  Example: 
      <b>graph_gui</b>; % sets up a GUI to draw a new graph 
 
  Example: 
      n = 10; t = 2*pi/n*(0:n-1); 
      A = round(rand(n)); 
      xy = 10*[cos(t); sin(t)]'; 
      <b>graph_gui</b>(A,xy); % loads a graph into the GUI for editing

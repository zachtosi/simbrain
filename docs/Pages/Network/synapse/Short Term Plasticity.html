        </p>
        <p span>This type of synapse will temporarily strengthen (&quot;facilitate&quot;) or weaken (&quot;depress&quot;) in response to source neuron activitiy. Every time the source neuron &quot;fires&quot;, the synapse strength moves incrementally towards its <a href="../synapse.html#upperbound">upper bound</a> or <a href="../synapse.html#lowerbound">lower bound</a>. When the source neuron does not fire, it decays back to a user-specified base-line strength.
            <p span> &quot;Firing&quot; has different meanings, depending on the type of the source neuron. If the source neuron is a <a href="../spikingnetworks.html">spiking neuron</a>, then firing is a discrete spiking event. If it is a non-spiking neuron, then any activation above some user-specified value counts as &quot;firing.&quot;

For short-term-depression, when the source neuron fires, the synapse's strength is decreased in proportion to its distance from the lower bound. Otherwise, the synapse's strength is increased in proportion to its distance from the base-line strength. </p>

For short-term-facilatation, when the source neuron fires, the synapse's strength is increased in proportion to its distance from the upper bound. Otherwise, the synapse's strength is decreased in proportion to its distance from the base-line strength.

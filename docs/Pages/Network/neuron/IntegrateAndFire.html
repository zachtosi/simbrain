        <h1>Integrate and and Fire</h1>
        <p>The (leaky) integrate and fire model is perhaps the most prevalent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neuron_model">biologically realistic model neuron</a> currently in use. It simulates all the basic aspects of neural conduction in a relatively simple framework.</p>
        <p> Simbrain's Integrate and Fire neuron is a <a href="../spikingnetworks.html">spiking neuron</a>. As a result, when it spikes, a ring of yellow flashes around it and the axon protruding from it turns yellow as well. </p>
        <p>
            Activation of the neuron is interpreted as voltage potential. When that voltage potential passes a threshold value, the neuron spikes (resulting in the flash of yellow), and then the voltage is reset to a reset value, typically below the threshold potential. Below threshold, the neuron behaves like the <a href="additive.html">additive neuron</a>. It decays to a steady state value at a rate proporitional to its time constant. </p>
        <p>Activation is computed by integrating the following differential equation using Euler's method:</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>where <em>r</em> is resting potential,<em> R</em> is resistance, &#964; is a time constant, and <em>W</em> is the weighted inputs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="heading">Threshold</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The value beyond which the neuron spikes. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="heading">Resting potential</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The activation value which the neuron decays to over time.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="heading">Reset potential</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The activation value which the neuron is reset to after a spiking event. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="heading">Resistance</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>A constant factor multiplied by weighted inputs. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="heading">Background Current
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>A constant background curent to the neuron.   Affects the baseline activation rule of the neuron.   Simulates a high conductance state which reflects the fact that <i>en vivo</i> neurons are constantly bombarded by inputs from other neurons.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="heading">Time constant</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Controls the rate at which the neuron attains its resting potential. As one increases this value, things become relatively slower; conversely, as one decreases this value, things become relatively faster.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="heading">Add Noise</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>If this is set to true, random values are added to the activation via a noise generator. For details how the noise generator works, click <a href="../../Utils/Randomizers/Randomizers.html">here</a>. </p>

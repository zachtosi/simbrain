<h1>Excitatory/Inhibitory Properties<br>
</h1><br>
<p>
The Excitatory/Inhibitory properties dialog is a sub-panel within the dialogs for making <a href="./alltoall.html">all to all</a> and <a href="sparse.html">sparse</a>
connections. Within this sub-panel the user can set the percentage of
connections which are excitatory (always complimentary to the
percentage of inhibitory connections), the type of synapses to be used
for inhibitory and excitatory connections, and the range and
distribution of the strengths of inhibitory and excitatory connections.
</p>
<br>

<blockquote>
<span class="heading">Setting the ratio of Excitatory to Inhibitory Connections</span><br>
<p><img style="border-style: solid; border-color: transparent; border-width: 10px 10px 0px; width: 487px; height: 112px;" src="../../../Images/percentExcitatorySlider.png" align="right"></p><div align="justify">The
percentage of connections which are excitatory over inhibitory can be
set using the Excitatory/Inhibitory slider or by specifying the percent
of excitatory connections manually in the % Excitatory text field.
Moving the slider completely to the left entails that all connections
will be inhibitory (weight strength in the inhibitory range, generally
some value less than 0), likewise moving the slider completely to the
right entails that all connections will be excitatory (weight strength
in the excitatory range, generally some value greater than 0). All
slider values in between will produce varying ratios of excitatory and
inhibitory connections. Setting the % of excitatory connections
manually with the text field entails (100-value entered)% of
connections will be inhibitory.</div><br>

<span class="heading">Setting Synapse Types</span><br>
<p><img style="border-style: solid; border-color: transparent; border-width: 10px 10px 0px; width: 377px; height: 76px;" src="../../../Images/synapseTypeButtons.png" align="right"></p><div align="justify">Using
the above buttons users may select the kind of synapse to be used
between a set of source and target neurons and furthermore specify
different types of synapses to be used for inhibitory or excitatory
connections, should they chose to. Clicking the synapse type buttons
brings up a synapse dialog (directions for the use of which can be
found <a href="../synapse.html">here</a>), after a new type of synapse is selected the text on the button will change to reflect that type.</div><br>

<span class="heading">Randomizing Connection Strengths</span><br>
<p><img style="border-style: solid; border-color: transparent; border-width: 10px 10px 0px; width: 323px; height: 95px;" src="../../../Images/randomConnectButtons.png" align="right"></p><div align="justify">Using
the above buttons one can randomize connection strengths before laying
down connections, furthmore one can specify the parameters used to
randomize these values. Otherwise, synaptic strengths will default to 1
for excitatory connections and -1 for inhibitory connections. Clicking
the dice button (after clicking the checkbox to enable randomized
weights) will bring up a <a href="../noisegenerator.html">random panel</a>
wherein the distribution type (uniform or gaussian), the upper and
lower bounds, and the standard deviation (if applicable) can be set. As
with other inhibitory/excitatory properties, the parameters for
randomily generating strength values is distinct for inhibitory and
excitatory connections. For instance: in the above picture, randomized
excitatory weights have been selected as evidenced by the colorized
dice; assuming their properties were then set, connection strengths for
excitatory connections will lie in the specified distribution and all
inhibitory connections will have a strength of -1.</div>

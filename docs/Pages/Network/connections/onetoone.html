<h1>One to one connection<br>
</h1><br>
<p>
One to one connects a set of source neurons to a set of target neurons
by index such that each source neuron is connected to only one other
target neuron. That is, neuron 1 in the set of source neurons is
connected to neuron 1 in the set of target neurons and so on and so
forth. If the source and target neurons are aligned horizontally, the
user must tell the one to one panel to make vertical connections in
order to maintain the one to one aesthetic and vice versa.
Additionally, the <a href="../synapse.html">synapse type</a>
can be specified as well as whether or not the connections are
bidirectional (in addition to source neuron 1 being connected to target
neuron 1, target neuron 1 is also connected to source neuron 1, and so
on).

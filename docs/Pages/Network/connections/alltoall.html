<h1>All to All Connection<br>
</h1><br>
<p>
All to All connects every source neuron to every target neuron. This is
the most standard class of connections when dealing with feed-forward
and fully recurrent neural networks. Optionally the user can set the
percentage of connections which are excitatory (complimentary to the
number of inhibitory connections), the type of <a href="../synapse.html">synapse</a>
(distinct between excitatory and inhibitory connections), and whether
or not the weights are randomized (including range, distribution,
etc.). The properties of the connections made by all to all can be set
by the <a href="excitatoryinhibitoryproperties.html">Excitatory/Inhibitory sub-panel</a>.
